Invoice Generator

Copyright (c) 2024 Vadim Vygonets <vadik@vygo.net>

The invoice generator is a document preprocessor and a troff
macro package for invoices and letters.  The inv preprocessor
turns a list of billed items into tbl source.  The -minv macro
package, built on top of -ms macros, formats the first page of a
letter, optionally including invoice-related information.

Example invoice source:

    .In 2024001 29.02.2024
    .Ad "Client GmbH"
    Geile Str. 0
    00000 Gutdorf
    .Ae
    .Tax 19
    .Charge 100 8 Hours Mindless keyboard bashing
    .Charge 50 2 Hours Playing with oscilloscopes

== Documentation:

To build doc/manual.pdf run:

    cd doc && make

== Quick start

    cp inc/conf-example.t inc/conf.t
    $EDITOR inc/conf.t
    mkdir dir
    cd dir
    cp ../inc/Makefile .
    cp ../examples/invoice.ms file.ms
    # or ../examples/letter.ms
    $EDITOR file.ms
    make file.pdf

== inc/Makefile

The default make target builds a .pdf for every .ms file in the
directory.  The clean target is intentionally commented out.

== Directory structure

Everything needed to build invoices is in the inc directory.
Keeping your invoices in this tree is silly, so symlink, copy,
point the $INVDIR environment variable to it or edit the Makefile
as you see fit.
